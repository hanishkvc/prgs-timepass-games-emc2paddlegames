A simple paddle game to test out the canvas in browsers using javascript.

Also as a thank you to few kids for helping out with making delicious pizzas,
as well as as a crude example to allow them to replicate and or expand and or ...
using their own logics, mechanisms, imagination, ... in their own environments be
it scratch or pygame or swift or browser-javascript or ...

And to provide some time pass, once in a bluemoon.

One can run this on a desktop/laptop by going to

The index.html itself contains the ui and the logic.
